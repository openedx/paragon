# Paragon | Algolia DocSearch

This module contains the Algolia DocSearch crawler configuration (i.e., ``crawler-config.js``) that controls the behavior of the Algolia site crawler responsible for indexing content from the Paragon documentation website to the Algolia index.

Any revisions to the configuration in this module must also be persisted upstream in the Algolia DocSearch crawler configuration.
