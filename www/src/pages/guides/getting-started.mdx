# Getting started

## Installation and usage

Paragon components require React 16 or higher. To install Paragon into your project:

In terminal:

```
npm i --save @edx/paragon
```

In your React project:

```jsx
import { ComponentName } from '@edx/paragon';
```

## SCSS Foundation

Usage with no theme:

```scss
@import "@edx/paragon/styles/scss/core/core.scss";
```

Usage with a theme:

When working with a theme the order of imports is important: if you need to override Paragon's variables you must import theme's variables before Paragon core (that's because all variables in Paragon use `!default` flag which allows you to override them before importing, you can read more [here](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/variables#default-values)), while to override Paragon's styles, the theme's style overrides must be imported after.

```scss
@import "@my-brand/fonts.scss";
@import "@my-brand/variables.scss";
// Import the Paragon core after setting brand-themed variables.
@import "@edx/paragon/styles/scss/core/core.scss";
// Import brand overrides after the Paragon core.
@import "@my-brand/overrides.scss";
```

Note that including fonts will affect load performance.  In some pages you may choose not to load the custom font.
