# Getting started

## Installation and usage

Paragon components require React 16 or higher. To install Paragon into your project:

In terminal:

```
npm i --save @openedx/paragon
```

In your React project:

```jsx
import { ComponentName } from '@openedx/paragon';
```

## CSS Foundation

### Usage with no theme
The Paragon CSS Foundation offers a collection of fundamental styles, encompassing padding, typography, and sizing.
When applied, these styles contribute to the creation of a straightforward and neat appearance for your application.

To integrate these foundational styles into your project, include the following import:

```scss
@use "@openedx/paragon/dist/core.min.css";
```

### Usage with a theme
In addition to the basic styles, you can provide a theme layer that includes styles for colors, shadows,
backgrounds and transparency of elements. This allows you to visually represent a specific theme in your application.

To apply these theme-specific styles, include the following import:

```scss
@use "@my-brand/light.min.css";
```
### CDN links
Alternative style integration is available when using CDN links:

```scss
@import url("https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@my-brand/core.min.css");
@import url("https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@my-brand/light.min.css");
```
