A Truncate component can help you crop multiline text. There will be three dots at the end of the text.

## Basic Usage

```jsx live
  <Truncate lines={2}>
    Learners, course teams, researchers, developers: the edX community includes groups with a range of reasons 
    for using the platform and objectives to accomplish. To help members of each group learn about what edX 
    offers, reach goals, and solve problems, edX provides a variety of information resources.

### HTML markdown support

**Note**: `Truncate` supports only plain `HTML` children and not `jsx`.

```jsx live
<Truncate lines={1}>
  <a href="#">Learners</a>, course teams, researchers, developers: the edX community includes <strong class="strong-class"><i class="i-class">groups with <u>a range</u> of <q>reasons</q></i></strong> for using the platform and objectives to accomplish.
</Truncate>
```
