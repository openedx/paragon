The `Alert` component displays a short, important message in a way that attracts the user's attention.
Alerts offer four severity levels that set a distinctive icon and color:
- **Info**: used to convey general information or actions that aren't critical, note that info variant should not contain any icons in it
- **Warning**: used to display information that needs attention
- **Success**: used for success messages
- **Danger**: used to communicate problems that have to be resolved immediately

This component utilizes and extends the `Alert` component from react-bootstrap.<br/> <a href="https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components/alerts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> See React-Bootstrap for additional documentation.</a>

## Basic Usage

```jsx live
<>
<Alert variant="success">
  This is a "success" alert with{' '}
  <Alert.Link href="#">an example link</Alert.Link>. Give it a click if you
  like.
</Alert>
<Alert variant="info">
  This is a "info" alert with{' '}
  <Alert.Link href="#">an example link</Alert.Link>. Give it a click if you
  like.
</Alert>
<Alert variant="danger">
  This is a "danger" alert with{' '}
  <Alert.Link href="#">an example link</Alert.Link>. Give it a click if you
  like.
</Alert>
<Alert variant="warning">
  This is a "warning" alert with{' '}
  <Alert.Link href="#">an example link</Alert.Link>. Give it a click if you
  like.
</Alert>
</>
```

### With Action Buttons
The ``Alert`` component supports a dismissible button and a custom call-to-action button, via the ``dismissible`` and ``button`` props respectively. The buttons may be right aligned or stacked. On extra small screen widths, the buttons will be stacked.

The stacked variant should be used for:
- Placement in sidebars or small container
- Extra-small breakpoint and below

    variant="info"
    actions={[
      <Button>Hello</Button>,
